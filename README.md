# Overview

This is a preliminary version of the codebase for the project `Unitary Convolutions for Message-passing and Positional Encodings on Directed Graphs`. 

To run experiments on datasets with directed edges, see the subfolder `directed_mpnns` and its readme. For experiments on undirected graphs that elaborate the role of edge features, see the `undirected_experiments` subfolder and its readme. 

Users should be able to run all experiments in this preliminary version of the codebase on either an Nvidia A100 GPU or an H100 with CUDA version 12.9.
